# Compiler Project

```bash
This branch is here to hold the old working py code, the dev branch will be the for-front still.
This branch will no long be worked on.
```

## Overview

This project aims to develop a lexical analyzer (scanner) for the Decaf 19 programming language as part of a compiler construction course. The lexical analyzer will read Decaf 19 source code, identify tokens, and categorize them according to the language's specifications.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- Anaconda

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a new Conda environment:

Replace `[source_code_file]` with the path to a Decaf 19 source file.

### Development

### Tools and Technologies

- Language: Python
- Environment Management: Anaconda
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

### Structure

- `scanner.py`: Main script for the lexical analyzer.
- `/tests`: Directory containing test scripts and example Decaf 19 programs.
